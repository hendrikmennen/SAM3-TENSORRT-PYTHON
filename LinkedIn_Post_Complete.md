🚀 Accelerating SAM3 with TensorRT: A Complete Python Pipeline

I'm excited to share my latest project - a production-ready implementation of Meta's Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM3) optimized with NVIDIA TensorRT for high-performance inference!

🔧 What I Built:
• Complete PyTorch → ONNX → TensorRT conversion pipeline
• FP16 optimization with dynamic shapes for flexible deployment
• Both bounding box detection and mask segmentation modes
• Interactive Gradio web UI for easy testing
• Comprehensive system diagnostics and validation tools

⚡ Key Features:
✅ Significant inference speedup using TensorRT engines
✅ Text-prompt based object detection and segmentation
✅ Modular architecture with separate encoders (vision, text, geometry) and decoder
✅ Pre-exported ONNX models available on Hugging Face
✅ Production-ready with proper error handling and documentation

🛠️ Tech Stack:
PyTorch | TensorRT | ONNX | CUDA | Python | Gradio | Transformers

The pipeline handles everything from model export to deployment, making it easy for anyone to leverage SAM3's powerful segmentation capabilities with GPU acceleration.

📦 Full code, documentation, and pre-built models available on GitHub!

From Research Paper to Production API: My Journey Optimizing SAM3 🚀

Meta's Segment Anything Model 3 is a breakthrough in computer vision - but there's a gap between "amazing research" and "production-ready system."

I spent the last few weeks bridging that gap. Here's what I learned:

📊 The Challenge:
• SAM3's multi-encoder architecture is complex to deploy
• Standard PyTorch inference is too slow for real-time apps
• Converting to optimized formats requires deep understanding of model internals
• No existing end-to-end pipeline for TensorRT deployment

🔨 What I Built:
A complete PyTorch → ONNX → TensorRT pipeline that:
✅ Handles all 4 model components (vision, text, geometry encoders + decoder)
✅ Optimizes with FP16 for 2x+ speedup
✅ Supports dynamic shapes for flexible deployment
✅ Includes interactive web UI for testing
✅ Provides pre-exported models on Hugging Face

💡 Key Learnings:
• Proper ONNX export with dynamic axes is crucial for TensorRT
• FP16 optimization requires careful validation
• Modular architecture makes debugging much easier
• Good documentation saves hours of support time

🎯 The Result:
Production-ready SAM3 inference with text prompts:
• "person" → detects all people in image
• "car" → finds vehicles
• Works in both bbox and segmentation modes
• Fast enough for real-time applications

This is now available as a complete open-source package with:
📦 Full source code on GitHub
🤗 Pre-built models on Hugging Face
📚 Comprehensive documentation
🖥️ Ready-to-use web interface
